Testing &amp; RPA using UiPath

In Project 4 we used UIPath to automate user acceptance testing.
To use the program the user only needs to run it, UIPath will enter all the needed information. data from the excel file "Connected Office Test Data" is used for the program to readfrom as well as write data testing results to.
